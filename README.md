# Ecolime

Ecolime contains all functions required to read and process all information pertaining to E. coli K-12 MG1655. This includes information such as the subunit/cofactor composition of metabolic enzymes or the stoichiometry for tRNA charging reactions.

The proceesed information is then passed into the COBRAme codebase and integrated into a functional ME-model for E. coli

## Installation

1. clone the repository
2. run ```python setup.py develop --user```
3. Run the latest Jupyter prototype notebook to build an ME-model using COBRAme
